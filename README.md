# FunZone
FunZone is an open-source control platform for small animatronics, haunted houses, escape rooms, and interactive art.  It glues together cheap microcontrollers, sensors, servos, MP3 boards, and lights using MQTT and Node-RED so you can build weird, reactive, story-driven spaces without reinventing the whole stack every time.  FunZone is open core
